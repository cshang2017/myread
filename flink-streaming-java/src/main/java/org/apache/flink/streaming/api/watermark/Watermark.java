/**
 * A Watermark tells operators that no elements with a timestamp older or equal
 * to the watermark timestamp should arrive at the operator. Watermarks are emitted at the
 * sources and propagate through the operators of the topology. Operators must themselves emit
 * watermarks to downstream operators using
 * {@link org.apache.flink.streaming.api.operators.Output#emitWatermark(Watermark)}. Operators that
 * do not internally buffer elements can always forward the watermark that they receive. Operators
 * that buffer elements, such as window operators, must forward a watermark after emission of
 * elements that is triggered by the arriving watermark.
 *
 * <p>In some cases a watermark is only a heuristic and operators should be able to deal with
 * late elements. They can either discard those or update the result and emit updates/retractions
 * to downstream operations.
 *
 * <p>When a source closes it will emit a final watermark with timestamp {@code Long.MAX_VALUE}.
 * When an operator receives this it will know that no more input will be arriving in the future.
